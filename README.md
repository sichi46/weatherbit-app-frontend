## 1. Project Overview

This is a full-stack Weather Application that provides users with real-time weather information and a 16-day weather forecast for any city, powered by the Weatherbit API. The app allows users to search for a city, view current weather conditions, and check the upcoming forecast. It also keeps track of the last five searches for easy access.

## 2. Features

Current Weather Display: Provides real-time data including temperature, weather description, wind speed, humidity, air quality index, etc.
16-day Forecast: Displays a detailed weather forecast for the upcoming 16 days.
Search History: Tracks and displays the last five searches.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Error Handling: Displays meaningful error messages if a city is not found or the API call fails.

## 3. Technologies Used

### Frontend

React.js: Component-based UI framework.<br>
Axios: For making HTTP requests.<br>
Tailwind CSS: For responsive design and styling.<br>
React Query: For caching and data fetching.<br>
ShadCN UI: For accessible UI components (Dialog, Toast).<br>
Lucide React: For icons.<br>

### Backend

Node.js: Backend environment.<br>
Express.js: Backend framework to handle API routes.<br>
Axios: For fetching data from the Weatherbit API.<br>
CORS: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.<br>
Morgan: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js.<br>
dotenv: For loading environment variables from a .env file.<br>
